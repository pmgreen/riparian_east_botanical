# Riparian East Botanical

A pilot project using free and open-source GIS tools [QField](https://qfield.org/) and [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) to help facilitate botanical inventories in the "[Riparian East](https://www.fopos.org/riparian-restoration-project)" restoration area by [Friends of Princeton Open Space](https://www.fopos.org/) (FOPOS) in Princeton, NJ. It was begun as a Rutgers Environmental Stewards project.

This is a [Kart](https://kartproject.org/) repository, with version control of geospatial data. This opens it up to be a collaborative project where all changes are tracked. To check it out, follow this [quick start](https://docs.kartproject.org/en/latest/pages/quick_guide.html#quick-guide) guide to install Kart and then either use the [QGIS Kart plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/kart/) or the command line to clone this repo. (For GIS nerds: it's essentially GPKG based.)
